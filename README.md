# USB-DAC
A high quality USB audio DAC.
This project is intended as a test for my larger music streamer project that implements a DAC chip together with a STM32 microconroller.
It accepts a music stream over USB, outputs the analog audio over balanced XLR connections and has an OLED display to show stream info.
